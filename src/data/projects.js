    name: 'Truck Inspection AI',
    tagline: 'Automated damage detection and OCR for fleet inspections.',
    category: 'Computer Vision',
    tags: ['Computer Vision', 'Logistics', 'OCR'],
    problem: 'Manual truck inspections are slow, inconsistent, and error-prone. Damage can be missed, and plate/asset IDs are often recorded incorrectly.',
    solution: 'A vision pipeline using detection and OCR to capture plates, asset IDs, and visible damage. Results are validated against fleet records and surfaced in a simple operator UI.',
    tech: 'YOLOv8, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, FastAPI, React, MongoDB, Docker',
    impact: 'Reduced average inspection time by 55% and improved damage detection recall from 62% to 89%. Automatic OCR reduced ID entry errors by 80%.',

    name: 'Bottle Counter for Bottling Plants',
    tagline: 'YOLO-based counting system for bottles on high-speed conveyors.',
    category: 'Computer Vision',
    tags: ['Computer Vision', 'Manufacturing', 'Analytics'],
    problem: 'Counting throughput manually or with simple beam sensors is inaccurate at high speeds and struggles with occlusion.',
    solution: 'Production-tuned model with region-of-interest tracking, frame differencing, and debounce logic to ensure accurate counts at > 800 bottles/min.',
    tech: 'YOLO, DeepSORT, OpenCV, Python, FastAPI, Grafana',
    impact: 'Counting accuracy increased to 98.7% with automated downtime detection and live dashboards for operators.',

    tagline: 'Real-time transcription and triage assistant for emergency call centers.',
    category: 'Voice AI',
    tags: ['Voice AI', 'Public Safety', 'LLM'],
    problem: 'Operators face intense cognitive load while capturing critical details and triaging calls, especially during peak events.',
    solution: 'Streaming ASR with domain-tuned language models to extract entities, classify incidents, and suggest actions. Integrates with CAD systems.',
    tech: 'Whisper/NeMo, FastAPI, WebSockets, Postgres, domain LLMs',
    impact: 'Average handle time reduced by 18%. Faster dispatch with improved capture of location and incident type.',

    category: 'Automation',
    tags: ['Automation', 'Data Enrichment'],
    problem: 'Sales teams spend hours compiling prospect lists and manually enriching data from scattered sources.',
    solution: 'ETL pipelines to collect data, dedupe, enrich with firmographics, and score based on ICP fit. Exports to CRM with audit logs.',
    tech: 'Python, Node, Airflow, FastAPI, Postgres, HubSpot/Salesforce APIs',
    impact: 'Saves 20+ hours/week per rep and improves reply rates with higher-quality targeting.',
